# Virtual distillation protocol for quantum error mitigation in bosonic modes

This repository contains the numerical simulations for the virtual distillation protocol. The full computation is done for initial noisy Fock states on which we measure the number operator. We consider noisy beam splitter operations parametrized by a gaussian noise on the target angles.
